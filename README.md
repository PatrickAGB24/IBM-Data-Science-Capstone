# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone

In this project, the goal is to predict the success rate of a rocket launch in SpaceX using attributes like the launch site, location and payload mass.

The outline of the process is as follows:

* Webscraping the data needed from the SpaceX website and data cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis through Python and SQL
* Predictive analysis by testing different models like logistic, decision tree, SVM and kth nearest neighbour and choosing the most accurate and optimal models using GridSearch
* Visualization using plots and maps using the Folium package
* Presenting data using the Dashboard app
